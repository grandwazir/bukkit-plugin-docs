{% contentfor warnings %}
**Upgrading to BanHammer 2.0 will rebuild your database. Your data will be imported and nothing should be lost. If you are at all worried make sure you make a backup of your .db file or SQL tables.**

Do not manually delete the old bh_bans table. Doing so will render the schema invalid and all your bans will be lost. This will be fixed in a future update. Additionally if you display bans on a webpage you will also need to update your scripts to match the new schema.
