{% contentfor warnings %}
Permissions have changed. You may need to update your configuration.
{% endcontentfor %}

{% contentfor improvements %}
<p>Wildcard permissions have been removed in favor of the new style permission nodes introduced with SuperPerms. This means for example where banhammer.ban.* would give you access to everything underneath that node, you now need to just grant banhammer.ban.</p>
<p>If you want to grant someone permission to use everything in the plugin you should now use the node banhammer.</p>
{% endcontentfor %}

{% contentfor features %}
<p>You can now use tab completion in the way you expect with all BanHammer commands. For example if you can not remember the name of the person you banned yesterday, simply type at least 3 letters of their name and the plugin will give you a list of all the people that match. It is that simple!</p>
