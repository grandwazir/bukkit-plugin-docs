## Simple creation

You create a kit by arranging the items that you want new players to have in your inventory then saving the kit. New players will receive an exact copy when they login, including durability and enchants.

## Complex item support

Use any item in your kit that Bukkit currently supports. This includes:

* Named items
* Armour with durability
* Coloured armour
* Books
* Maps
* ... and anything else!
